# ipl_data_analysis
Explored data from the DC versus RCB game, providing insights into each ball, over, run, and wicket. Conducted analysis on top scorers, run rates, strike rates, types of dismissals, run distribution, and phase analysis throughout the match.
1.	The run distribution per over for both teams. Here are some insights:
•	The scoring rate for each team shows fluctuations throughout their innings, with spikes indicating overs with high scoring, likely due to boundaries or big hits.
•	Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) appears to have a couple of overs with significantly higher runs, suggesting aggressive batting.![image](https://github.com/JainyGandhi/ipl_data_analysis/assets/58180373/eceb4d1c-13da-471e-a9aa-d1d4410c9c25)

3.	Wickets Taken and economy rate:
•	The bars indicate the number of wickets each bowler took during the match. The height of the bars reflects how successful the bowlers were in terms of taking wickets. Bowlers from both teams contributed to taking wickets, with some notable performances that stand out due to higher bars.
•	Economy Rate: The line graph overlaid on the bar graph shows the economy rate (number of runs conceded per over) of each bowler. The economy rate is crucial as it indicates how economically a bowler has bowled in terms of runs given away. ![image](https://github.com/JainyGandhi/ipl_data_analysis/assets/58180373/3c1fedab-7c17-44d8-95d2-5709e758655a)


4.	A clear breakdown of the match into different phases; Powerplay, Middle, and Death, and illustrates how each team performed during these segments:
•	Powerplay: Both teams have a relatively low total of runs, with RCB losing more wickets than DC in this phase, as indicated by the height of the orange line.
•	Middle: This phase shows the highest run-scoring for both teams, with DC scoring slightly more than RCB. The wickets lost remain controlled, suggesting stable innings from both teams.
•	Death: RCB has a sharp decrease in runs compared to the Middle phase, while DC maintains a high run rate. Wickets lost by RCB increased significantly in this phase, marked by the orange line peaking near 4.5, indicating a possible collapse or aggressive batting that did not pay off.![image](https://github.com/JainyGandhi/ipl_data_analysis/assets/58180373/958e57e5-be07-490f-9621-5f26aad5dfe9)




5.	Here are the top performers in terms of strike rate from the match:
•	J Fraser-McGurk had the highest strike rate at 262.50, scoring 21 runs from just 8 balls.
•	Virat Kohli also scored efficiently, with a strike rate of 192.86, making 27 runs from 14 balls.
•	Rajat Patidar contributed significantly with a strike rate of 152.94, accumulating 52 runs from 34 balls.

6.	Run rate:
•	RCB Run Rate Fluctuations: RCB’s run rate shows significant fluctuations, peaking at around 3.5 runs per ball towards the end of the innings. The presence of wicket markers (red circles) indicates that wickets were taken during overs where the run rate was generally lower, which is typical as wickets tend to disrupt batting flow.
•	DC Run Rate Patterns: DC’s run rate starts strong but sees a sharp decline after the initial overs, stabilizing somewhat in the middle before another peak and subsequent fall towards the end. Wickets (blue circles) are taken in overs where the run rate drops, suggesting effective bowling from RCB during these times. ![image](https://github.com/JainyGandhi/ipl_data_analysis/assets/58180373/f62a8b54-a629-4f1f-9971-99b3844a03ed)
